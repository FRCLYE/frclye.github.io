<h1>Stop writting half-assed emails</h1>

<p>If you've ever worked in an office you know that email is king. It's where all communication, coordination and execution happens and honestly itâ€™s because it definitely is a great tool.</p>

<p>Sadly it can also be completely burdening to the point of being a nuisance. For lots of people, email ends up being counterproductive. There are particularly two things that are landmarks of email communication but which have become <b>terrible practices: FYI and ASAP.</b></p>

<p>Please, just stop using FYI. Forwarding an email with just "FYI" is something that we've come to accept but it's actually pretty awful and does not accomplish any of the intended results. No one is going to read an entire thread of emails with multiple unrelated topics just to find that piece of information that apparently was important enough.</p>

<p>In fact, what might be considered central to someone working on a certain task or department might not be apparent for a receiver working on something completely different. It also doesn't do a good job of letting the other person know if any specific action is to be taken or if it's really just to keep them informed.</p>

<p>That's not what FYI is supposed to be. The intended use is relaying the precise information and that no action is to be taken (otherwise it'd be self-evident). But that's not the usage people are giving it, and in the end that's all that matters.</p>

<p>I do have a solution though. If you find yourself using FYI, please change it to <b>TL;DR</b> (too long, didn't read). The idea is to take the time to write a small line or paragraph where you explain:</p>

<p>1. what the important information is<br>2. whether it's important for the receiver to take notice or acknowledge it<br> 3. whether or not any actions need to be taken.</p>

<p><b>In breif, summarize it.</b></p>

<p>I mean, you don't really have to change it to TL;DR, you can keep the "FYI" and just make sure to add these three new components. But I would try to avoid it like the plague just to make sure we don't fall back again on the lazy forwarding we have today.</p>

<p>In the same vein, ASAP has mostly come to replace the unhelpful language of urgency we used to have before.</p>

<p>Thanks to people constantly labeling everything as "urgent" just to push their own needs and problems first, using that that word is sort of frowned upon nowadays. Unluckily we have replaced it with the softer "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>The problem is that it still bears the same message: "I need this, and I need it now". If ASAP is just another word for urgent and everything is urgent at all times then it's completely useless.</p>

<p>If on the contrary, ASAP is used as "it would be nice if this was done soon", it would still be useless as we have no way of knowing which usage the sender intended, also "soon" means absolutely nothing. As with the former case, I suggest that we add something else to the request. </p>

<p>First explain clearly why something needs to be done, the recipient may not know be aware of the same context you are or perhaps they're working on something totally unrelated and have no idea why you need it. Secondly, this way you can add in a deadline that actually works for everyone. Not a real deadline like, this needs to be done monday. That's impolite and you'll only be hated.</p>

<p>What you can do is <b>explain when you'd need it after you've explained why</b>, which is usually what's truly important.</p>

<p>Is it something that needs to be done right now because you have a huge problem? That's okay, just explain what your problem is and why it's so critical.</p>

<p>Is it something that needs to be done in the near future but not right now? Sure, explain precisely that.</p>

<p>Does it need to be done before something that has a deadline? Is it related to something else? Does it matter if it's done properly or do you need it fast?</p>

<p>You get the point. Just don't use FYI and ASAP as some lazy way of making sure you took action or passed down some information. That's poor management and judgment.</p>
