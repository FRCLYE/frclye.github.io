<h1>Stop writing half-assed emails</h1>
<em class="article-date">I wrote this around december 2024</em>

<p>If you've ever worked in an office you know that email is king. It's where all communication and
    coordination happens. Honestly, itâ€™s because it's a great tool.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, it often ends up being counterproductive. There are  two things that are landmarks 
    of email communication but which have become <b>terrible practices: FYI and ASAP.</b></p>

<h2>Stop using FYI</h2>

<p>Please, just stop using it. Forwarding an email with just "FYI" is something that we've come to accept 
    but it's actually pretty useless and does not accomplish any of the intended results. No one is going to 
    read that entire thread with mostly unrelated inforomation just to find that piece of information that 
    apparently was important enough.</p>

<p>In fact, what might be considered central to someone working on a certain department might not be 
    apparent for a receiver working on something completely different. It also doesn't do a good job of letting
     the other person know if any specific action is to be taken or if it's really just to keep them informed.</p>

<p>That's not what FYI is supposed to be. The intended use is relaying the precise information and that no action
     is to be taken. But that's not the usage people are giving it, and in the end that's all that matters.</p>

<p>I do have a solution though. If you find yourself using FYI, please change it to <b>TL;DR</b> (too long, didn't read).
     The idea is to take the time to write a small line or paragraph where you explain:</p>

<p>1. what the important information is<br>2. whether it's important for the receiver to take notice or 
    acknowledge it<br> 3. whether or not any actions need to be taken.</p>

<p><b>Summarize it!</b></p>

<p>I mean, you don't really have to change it to TL;DR, you can keep the "FYI" and just make sure to add these 
    three new components. But I would try to avoid it like the plague just to make sure we don't fall back again
     on the lazy forwarding we have today.</p>

<h2>The problem with ASAP</h2>

<p>In the same vein, ASAP has mostly come to replace the unhelpful language of urgency we used to have before.</p>

<p>Thanks to people constantly labeling everything as "urgent" just to push their own needs and problems over the rest,
     using that that word is sort of frowned upon nowadays. Unluckily we have replaced it with the softer "as soon 
     as possible".</p>

<p>The problem is that it still bears the same message: "I need this, and I need it now". If ASAP is just another
     word for urgent and we all know that if everything is urgent at all times then nothing is.</p>

<p>Thankfully I believe the solution is esentially the same as for FYI: explain briefly what the deal is!</p>

<p>Explain clearly <b>why something needs to be done</b>. The recipient may not know be aware of the same context or perhaps they're 
    working on something totally unrelated. This way you can agree on a deadline that actually works for everyone.</p>

<p>Is it something that needs to be done right now because you have a huge problem?<br> That's okay, just explain 
    what your problem is and why it's so critical.</p>

<p>Is it something that needs to be done in the near future but not right now?<br> Sure, explain precisely that.</p>

<p>Does it need to be done before something that has a deadline? Is it related to something else? Does it matter 
    if it's done properly or do you need it fast?</p>

<p>You get the point. Just don't use FYI and ASAP as some lazy way of making sure you took action or passed down 
    some information. That's poor judgment.</p>
