<h1>Hello there!</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Lautaro but people call me Lauti. I'm from a small country in South America 
    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay">Uruguay</a> but I currently I live in <em><b>Europe</b></em>.</p>

<p>This is a small blog  I made where I  share a little bit about my projects and things that I find interesting.</p>

<p>At college I majored in international relations and have been working in the supply chain field these past few years.
    International trade is kind of how I make a living.</p>

<p>I really like learning languages, as of now I speak Spanish, English, French and some Russian.</p>
    
<p>I've recently decided to improve my coding skills and I'm trying to get some python projects under my belt. 
    I'll be documenting my progress.</p>
