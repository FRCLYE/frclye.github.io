<h1>Hello there!</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Lautaro but people call me Lauti! I'm from a small country in South America 
    called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay">Uruguay</a> but I currently I live in <em><b>undefined</b></em>.</p>

<p>This is a small blog  I made where I can share a little bit about my projects and things
     that I find interesting.</p>

<p>At college I majored in international relations and have been working in the supply chain field these past few years.
    International trade is kind of how I make a living.</p>

<p>I also really like learning languages, as of now I speak Spanish (my native languge), 
    English, French and some Russian.</p>
    
<p>I've recently decided to improve my coding skills and I'm trying to get some python projects working.
    Stay around becaouse I'll be documenting my progress.</p>
