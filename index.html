<h1>Blog</h1>

<p>Hello, I'm Lautaro, although people call me Lauti.</p>

<p>This is a small blog  I made where I can share a little bit about my projects and things
     that I find interesting.</p>

<p>At college I majored in international Relations and have been working in the supply chain field these past few years.
    International trade is kind of how I make a living.</p>

<p>I'm mostly into languages, politics, technology and urbanism. 
    I've recently decided to one-up my coding skills and
    I'm trying to get some python projects working</p>

<p>I also really like learning languages, as of now I speak Spanish (my native languge), 
    English, French and some Russian. I'm planning to write this blog moslty in English but
    the occasional spanish article might appear.</p>
